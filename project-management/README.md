# Project Management

**Current Project:** High Priority CI Fixes
**Start Date:** December 11, 2025
**Coordinator:** Project Orchestrator
**Status:** 🔴 IN PROGRESS - CRITICAL ISSUES

**Previous Project:** Code Review Remediation (✅ COMPLETE - December 10, 2025)

## Current Project Overview

Two critical CI pipeline issues have been identified and FIXED:

1. ✅ **Database "root" User Error** - E2E tests failed with `FATAL: role "root" does not exist`
   - Root cause: `playwright.config.ts` webServer wasn't receiving DATABASE_URL
   - Fix: Added `env` property to pass DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, MODE to webServer

2. ✅ **E2E Test Performance** - Tests took 1.5+ hours
   - Root cause: Running 5 browsers with 1 worker and 2 retries in CI
   - Fix: CI now runs only Chromium with 2 workers and 1 retry (~13x faster)

**Status:** Implementation complete, ready for CI validation.
